/*
    The Important Points About LinkedList are :
        * Underline data structure is Double Linked List
        * Insertion Order is Preserved
        * Duplicates are allowed
        * Heterogeneous Objects are allowed
        * Null Insertion is Possible
        * Linked List Implements serializable and cloneable interface but not random access
        * Linked List is the best choice for frequent insertion and deletion operation
        * Worst choice for frequent retrieval operation
