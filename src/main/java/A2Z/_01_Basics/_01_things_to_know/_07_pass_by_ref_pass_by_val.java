Q~ Is Java Pass-By-Reference or Pass-By-Value?
A~   A simple Google search of this question will return a straightforward answer that Java is always pass-by-value.
    The reason this question is confusing is because Java achieves its functionality using special variable types known
    as object references.
    --->
    Pass-by-reference:
        When a method is called, the method arguments reference the same variable in memory as the caller.
    Pass-by-value:
        When a method is called, the caller passes a copy of the argument variables to the method resulting in two
        values in memory.
