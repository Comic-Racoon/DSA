Primitive Data Types:

    Predefined by the language.
    Named by reserved keywords.
    Include:
        boolean
        char
        byte
        short
        int
        long
        float
        double
    Total: 8

Non-primitive Data Types:

    Refer to objects, hence called reference types.
    Include:
        String
        Arrays
        Classes
        Interfaces

Java is strongly typed, with type capability checked by the compiler.
Java is considered a pure object-oriented language compared to older languages.
However, Java lacks some features of pure OOP like operator overloading and multiple inheritance.
Data type characteristics:

    Number types (integer and float) are signed.
    Character data type uses letters and numbers.
    Boolean data type uses true and false.

Primitive Data Type Characteristics:

    short:
        Size: 2 bytes
        Best suitable for 16-bit processors like 8085.
    int:
        Size: 4 bytes
    long:
        Size: 8 bytes
        Used for calculations involving very long distances, such as in satellite systems.
    float:
        Size: 4 bytes
        Used for accuracy up to 5 to 6 decimal points.
    double:
        Size: 8 bytes
        Used for accuracy up to 14 to 15 decimal points.
    boolean:
        Size: NA
        Range: NA
        Allowed values: true, false
